Context:

I created this app to allow users to generate polls for their own entertainment. The ultimate goal of this
site is to allow voting by users so that the creator can gain feedback on any topic they can imagine, whether for personal entertainment, or to make decisions with a large group.

User Experience:

Upon page load, the user has the option to sign up or sign in. If they do not have an account, they can search for polls by index number. Once signed in a user can create a poll, or modify or delete an existing poll. Once clicked voting is added in the poll display will be altered significantly.

As the application stands, voting and indexing by topics have not been added. The site will eventually contain a database of user's votes, allowing them to see their past votes, and the results of these polls. Guests will be able to search by topic and see the results when polls are viewed.

User Stories:
- As a guest I want to view a poll
- As a guest I want to create an account
- As a user I want to sign in
- As a user I want to write a poll
- As a user I want to search for a poll
- As a user I want to edit a poll
- As a user I want to delete a poll
- As a user I want to view all the polls I wrote
- As a user I want to vote on a poll
- As a user I want to view the results of a poll I voted on
- As a user I want to view the results of a poll I created

Features that will be added:
- Index of created polls
- Index of polls by user
- Voting functionality
- Search by topic
- Scalable number of options
